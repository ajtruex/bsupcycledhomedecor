Bonnie introduced Susan to her love of crafting and upcycling old items into new treasures. Soon this became a love for both of us and so we started crafting together often. We made home decor for ourselves, gifts for friends and loved ones. We were encouraged to start selling our stuff so we did! We were having so much fun we decided to start a small venture called BS Upcycled Home Decor & More. We will be setting up at events around the Marion and Hamilton County areas starting with the 3rd Annual Noblesville Preservation Alliance Flea Market on Saturday May 21st from 9am-3pm on Logan Street and Clinton Street in Noblesville. Our booth will be in the Randall & Roberts Funeral Home parking lot, 1150 Logan Street. Please stop by and check us out!
