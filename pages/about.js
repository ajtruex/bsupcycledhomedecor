        Hi, we are Bonnie and Susan, two besties that were hanging out and
        trying to make the most of it during Covid. Bonnie introduced Susan to
        her love of crafting and upcycling old items into new treasures. Soon
        this became a love for both of us and so we started crafting together
        often. We made home decor for ourselves, gifts for friends and loved
        ones. We were encouraged to start selling our stuff so we did! We were
        having so much fun we decided to start a small venture called BS
        Upcycled Home Decor & More. We will be setting up at events around the
        Marion and Hamilton County areas!
