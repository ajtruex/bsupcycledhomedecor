      <p>Hi, we are Bonnie and Susan, two besties that were hanging out and trying to make the most of it during Covid.
        Bonnie introduced Susan to her love of crafting and upcycling old items into new treasures. Soon this became a
        love for both of us and so we started crafting together often. We made home decor for ourselves, gifts for
        friends
        and loved ones. We were encouraged to start selling our stuff so we did! We were having so much fun we decided
        to
        start a small venture called BS Upcycled Home Decor & More. We will be setting up at events around the Marion
        and
        Hamilton County areas starting with the 3rd Annual Noblesville Preservation Alliance Flea Market on Saturday May
        21st from 9am-3pm on Logan Street and Clinton Street in Noblesville. Our booth will be in the Randall & Roberts
        Funeral Home parking lot, 1150 Logan Street. Please stop by and check us out!
